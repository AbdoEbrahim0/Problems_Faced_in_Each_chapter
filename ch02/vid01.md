## Issue: Unable to Edit or Access Restored Database

### Problem
After restoring a SQL Server database, you may encounter issues where the database is inaccessible or read-only. Attempts to edit or interact with the database fail due to ownership or permission conflicts.

### Solution
To resolve this:

1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
2. In the **Object Explorer**, right-click the restored database and select **Properties**.
3. Navigate to the **Files** page.
4. Locate the **Owner** field and change it to `sa` (System Administrator).
5. Click **OK** to apply the changes.

### Notes
- The `sa` account is the default system administrator in SQL Server and typically has full access.
- This step ensures proper ownership and restores full control over the database.
